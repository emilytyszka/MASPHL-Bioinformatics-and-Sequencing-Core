# MASPHL-Whole-Genome-Sequencing

## Overview
Analyses were conducted for the Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory's Sequencing and Bioinformatics Core Division. The laboratories conducted sequencing of microbiological and viral isolates from hospitals, environmental sampling, and outbreak investigation across the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I worked with the Sequencing Core to troubleshoot sequencing related issues and to visualize results. See Variant Analysis projects in [Wastewater Analyses](/MASPHL-Wastewater-Analyses) to see WGS results relating to wastewater monitoring.

## Major Projects
- _CT Values Analysis_: Comparison of CT values across platforms and submitters for COVID-19 clinical samples.
- _Variant Analysis_: Visualizing COVDI-19 variant frequencies in municipal wastewater.

## Meeting/Group Attendance
- _BI Group_ (ongoing)
